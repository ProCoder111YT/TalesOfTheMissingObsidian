Has always been a wild girl.
Due to an upsetting event in her past she always tries to hide her pains via constant distractions such as drinking. Anything to silence the silence. 
During her time she used to date Matt Dwellen but there was a point where he got abusive and the relationship soured so Prita put an end to it. 
Recently they met Matt Dwellen again through mutual friend Ghatti but he was anything but himself; kind, calm, respectful. Though not intending to start a relationship with them again but they decided to start a friendship.
When starting the friendship she felt skeptical but she's slowly come to trust.
